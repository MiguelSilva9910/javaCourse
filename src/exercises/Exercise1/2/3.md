###Exercise 1
        Create a program which produces the following output:

            SHOPPING LIST
                - Milk
                    > Semi-skimmed

                - Bread
     */
###Exercise 2
    If you used multiple print/println statements in Exercise 1, rewrite the program using only a single print/println method (or vice versa).
###Exercise 3
    Create a program which produces the following output:
    The
